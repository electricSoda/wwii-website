              <h3>Mussolini’s background</h3>
              <p>Benito Mussolini was born into a poor family, with his dad being a blacksmith, and his mom a school teacher. His dad spoke a lot about politics and was a socialist. Mussolini was an aggressive and disobedient child, often being the bully at school. He even stabbed a fellow student. However, he was also very intelligent. As an adult, he read many philosophers and theorists, without much of a political philosophy yet. He became a political journalist and a public speaker soon after, sometimes being arrested for his controversial opinions. Mussolini, after WWI, went from a socialist to an anti-socialist. Emerging in 1918, he advocated for a dictator who was “a man who is ruthless and energetic enough to make a clean sweep” in Italy. He created a new party in Italy called the “fighting bands”. This was the beginning of fascism. His movement gained more traction and he came to power in 1922 where he became the youngest prime minister in Italy.

              <h3>Mussolini's influence on Hitler</h3>
              <p>In the early years of Mussolini’s regime in Italy, Hitler was a great admirer of him. He was fascinated by Mussolini's “march on Rome”, a protest by fascists which led to Mussolini becoming prime minister. Hitler tried to replicate this too: the Munich putsch. Furthermore, Mussolini even supported the Nazi Party through funding and military training with his Blackshirts (his paramilitary). On the outside, Mussolini gave high praise to Hitler’s rise to power, but on the inside he hated Hitler and his party, describing his Mein Kampf as boring, and his ideas and theories as “coarse” and simplistic”. 
               <br> Mussolini and Hitler <b>both</b> considered white Europeans to be architects of civilization and culture
               <br> However, Mussolini <b>did not</b> discriminate against Jewish like Hitler did and scornfully insulted Hitler’s regime.

            <h2 style="text-align:center;">To what extent should Mussolini be considered a significant player in the history of WWII?</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Benito Mussolini, the Italian dictator that gave rise to fascism in the 1920s, was one of the most influential figures during WWII. His authoritarian vision, his leadership skills, his unwavering resilience gave him an edge against his adversaries. Mussolini’s rise to power was not unexpected ever since the creation of the fascist party in Italy. However, the question remains: to what extent did Mussolini impact the course of WWII?     </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;After the quick siege for control from the fascist party, Mussolini became the prime minister of Italy. In a short period of time, Mussolini transformed Italy into a fascist state. Propaganda was instrumental in shaping public perception and consolidating support for Mussolini's regime. A national youth group was created: The Opera Nazionale Balilla, and all other youth groups were banned. This essentially meant that the entire Italian youth would go through propaganda and a nationalistic upbringing, ensuring Mussolini’s continued power. Furthermore, the previous socialistic-dominated parliament was banished and replaced by an entirely fascist body of legislators. Cinemas also were forced to spread propaganda. Journalism was restricted, and although journalists were permitted to criticize the government, they had to generally support the regime. An age of fascism was born.</p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Now, how does this impact WWII?  A leader took notice of Mussolini’s ideologies, admiring his success. This leader would later become the infamous dictator, Adolf Hitler. Hitler, seeing Mussolini’s success in converting Italy into a fascist state, took heavy inspiration from fascism. Mussolini even supported Hitler in his rise to power, allowing his army to train with Hitler’s. After the Nazi party gained tremendous power and began invading other countries, Italy joined forces in the Axis powers. They had created a strong alliance, both promoting the fascist ideology. However, this would be cut short with Italy’s defeat in African colonies, the Allied invasion of Italy, and the ultimate downfall of Nazi Germany in 1945.</p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Even with these short-lived fascist regimes, the legacy remains. Without Mussolini’s success and powerful fascist ideology, Hitler’s regime would have not been what it was. The authoritarian and nationalistic government was the foundation for Nazi Germany. Mussolini’s success with it was without a doubt the driving factor in Hitler and the Nazi party’s rise to power. With the rise of fascism during WWII, it is clear that without Mussolini’s influence in this world war, Hitler’s success would have not been as great, significantly altering the entire history of WWII. </p>

              <h3>Rise of Anti-semitism in Europe: 1 CE - 1950 CE</h3>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">Antisemitism in Europe has been a long debated topic. It dates back before the Common Era, back to when Abraham, the father of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, created the nation of Israel. Before the common era (BCE), Hebrews (early Jewish people) faced persecution because they wouldn’t adopt the religion of other kingdoms. This resulted in the resentment of the Hebrews. After what scholars believe to be the birthdate of Jesus Christ (1 CE), Christianity became a dominant religion, mainly due to the Roman Empire, and since Jewish people refused to accept Jesus, more animosity spawned between Judaism and Christianity. During the Middle Ages, further discrimination against Jews ensued, including that Jews couldn’t marry Christians, couldn’t hold government positions, and that Jews engaged in routine murders of Christians. More and more prejudice against Jews continued, including them becoming the scapegoat for the Bubonic plague during the 14th Century. Throughout the 15-16th century, Christians repeatedly called for the killing of Jews, and in the 13th century, they had to wear a symbol to denote that they were Jewish (something Nazis used as well). These beliefs carried into the modern era, with French,Russian, German, Ukrainian, and English Jews all being persecuted.          </p>

            <h2>Nazism</h2>
            <p style="padding: 2em; margin-top: -3em;">Also called National Socialism, Nazism is the ideology of racial purity, territorial expansion, nationalism, and militarism. Seen in Nazi Germany, this ideology adds to fascism with a prejudice against Jews.</p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 1em;">Rise of Concentration Camps</h2>
            <p style="padding: 2em; margin-top: -3em;">The first concentration camp was created in March 1933 in Dachau. This would become one of the most infamous camps and longest running one. These camps were places where the Nazis kept “enemies of the state” and killed them. Essentially, anyone Nazis determined as “weird” and inferior to their race would be confined in harsh conditions. These included:
              <ul style="text-align: left; margin-top: -1em;">

            origin, were persecuted and deported. Some were killed immediately, while others were degraded,

                <h3>Kristallnacht and the concept of Lebensraum</h3>
                <p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">Lebensraum also stands for “living space” and is the belief that a “nation had to be self sufficient in terms of resources and territory to protect itself from external threats”. A famous German geographer Friedrich Ratzel was the one that coined this phrase. He argued that the success of a nation was influenced by their geographic territory, and therefore nations should expand into other territories. Ratzel said that Germany needed to colonize other territories to prevent German overpopulation. This was one of the beliefs that led to the Nazi colonization of east Europe. One event of this was famously known as Kristallnacht. In 1938, Nazi leaders “unleashed pogroms against the Jewish population in Germany”. It was called Kristallnacht or The Night of Broken glass because there was broken glass on the streets after the purge of Jewish communities.</p>

                <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 2.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;">Hitler’s decision to invade Poland in 1939 was fueled by the concept of Lebensraum and his prejudice against the “inferior people”. He wanted Germans to live in Poland, and also considered Polish people to be inferior. This would mark the start of WWII, after England and France declared war on Germany.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center;">To what extent was Hitler’s rise to power inevitable?</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Hitler’s rise to power was inevitable. In 1933, he became the chancellor of Germany after multiple successes in the election campaign. The moment Hitler came into power, he completely transformed Germany. Let’s start from the beginning. Before his infamous political career, he was a veteran of WWI. He was resentful after the Treaty of Versailles, which penalized the Germans and shone a bad light on his country. Some of the reparations that Germany had to pay were $33 billion in war reparations, surrender territory to other countries, and they had extreme military restrictions.            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The impacts of the Treaty of Versailles were vast. The German economy plummeted and the economy became extremely unstable. According to the <a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/how-did-adolf-hitler-happen" target="_blank" style="color: white;">National WWII Museum</a>, 4 billion German marks were equal to 1 American dollar. This was a golden opportunity for the patriotic Hitler and fellow patriotic German friends to gain support. Hitler created the Nazi party in 1920. After rallying up a group of supporters, the Nazi movement began to gain momentum in 1921, and later grew to 15,000 men in 1923. Hitler tried to throw the government in 1923 but to no avail, and famously landed him in prison, where he wrote Mein Kampf.             </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;	However, the Nazi party still didn’t gain much popularity, especially when they only received 2.6% of the vote in the 1928 elections (WWII Museum). With the increasing economic depression, Hitler managed to capitalize on it by promising to restore all order and make Germany “great” again (with a twist, of course). With this, the Nazi gained more popularity in 1932. After a series of events, including the President dying, Hitler went from Chancellor of Germany to taking absolute control. </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;This was inevitable. Ever since the Treaty of Versailles and the first world war, the world was left in shambles. Hitler, with his clever leadership skills, managed to persuade the emotion of the German public and promised to restore Germany. The economic depression, unstable German government, and Hitler’s public speaking skills made his rise to power almost impossible not to predict.             </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Things could have been different, though, if President Hindenburg didn’t appoint Hitler as chancellor. Furthermore, tension within the government also contributed to Hitler’s rise. If many politicians didn’t try to preserve their own livelihoods, public support might’ve never swayed towards Hitler. Most of the errors were made by President Hindenburg in which he allowed Hitler to suspend democracy in the Weimar Republic.</p>

              <h2>The Battle of Midway</h2>
              <p>The Battle of Midway on June 4-7, 1942, is often considered the turning point of the Pacific War in favor of the United States. On June 4, six months after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, four Japanese aircrafts bombarded the American base on Midway Atoll. American naval forces in the area quickly responded with their own series of attacks against the Japanese, taking down 3 of the 4 aircrafts. The reason behind America’s speedy response was that US intelligence had been aware of an incoming attack by the Japanese. They had broken Japanese communication codes prior to the attack and discovered the Japanese’s plans to attack Midway Atoll. On June 7, the Japanese finally abandoned the battle, having lost 3,057 men, four carriers, one cruiser, and hundreds of aircraft. The US, on the other hand, only lost 362 men, one carrier, one destroyer, and 144 aircrafts. Japan’s huge loss of munition prevented them from further expanding in the Pacific, providing the US with an opportunity to begin shrinking Japan’s influence over the Pacific through island-hopping invasions.             </p>

              <h2>The Battle of Guadalcanal</h2>
              <p>          The Battle of Guadalcanal was fought between August 1942 and February 1943 in the Solomon Islands, northeast of Australia. It was a pivotal battle in the Pacific Theater. This grueling campaign marked the first major offensive by Allied forces against Japanese expansion in the region. There was intense ground, naval, and aerial combat across the island’s rugged terrain and surrounding waters. Guadalcanal’s strategic importance lay in its field, Henderson Field, which both sides fiercely contested. The eventual Allied victory at Guadalcanal halted Japan’s advance and marked a turning point in the Pacific War. It provided a vital foothold for further Allied advances towards Japan and bolstered morale after a series of setbacks. In total, the Japanese lost 24,000 men, while the Americans lost 1,600 men killed in the battle, with several thousand more succumbing to malaria and other tropical diseases.</p>

              <h2>The Battle of Iwo Jima</h2>
              <p>On February 19, 1945, the US invaded Iwo Jima, an island located 750 miles off the coast of Japan. This came after months of naval and air bombardment by the US. The US was interested in the strategic value of the island, having three airfields that they could use as landing sites for B-29 planes. Two of these planes would later be used to drop the atomic bombs on Japan. The Battle of Iwo Jima lasted for five weeks and proved to be one of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific Theater. Despite the challenges of fighting on the island’s rugged terrain, the US forces eventually captured the island on March 26, 1945. However, victory came at a heavy cost, with over 6,000 American lives lost and more than 19,000 wounded. Still, the US’ capture of the island provided strategic advantages for its military, such as a shortened distance for American bombers flying to and from Japan, contributing to the end of the war in the Pacific.            </p>

              <p>The Battle of Okinawa, fought between April 1 and June 21, 1945, was the last major battle of WWII. On April 1, US ground forces of more than 60,000 soldiers and marines landed on the island of Okinawa. This was part of the operation codenamed Operation Iceberg, which called for the invasion of the chain of islands known as the Ryukyus to the southwest of Japan. Okinawa’s strategic importance lay in it being the largest island of the Ryukyus, as well as its proximity to the Japanese mainland, making it a crucial stepping stone for the planned invasion of Japan. Despite facing fierce resistance from Japanese troops and kamikaze attacks, Allied forces eventually secured victory on June 22, 1945. This battle was the bloodiest battle of the Pacific Theater, with over 49,000 Allied and 86,000 Japanese troops killed. Adding to that death toll was more than 149,000 Okinawan civilians who were caught in between the crossfire.              </p>

              <p>          On August 6 and 9, 1945, American B-29 planes dropped two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The bomb named “Little Boy” was dropped first on Hiroshima, and the one named “Big Man” was dropped on Nagasaki. Most of the casualties came from the Hiroshima bombing, with 70,000-90,000  people dying at the instance the bomb detonated. The US dropped these bombs in order to force a quick surrender by the Japanese. Many Japanese officials did not want further civilian casualties by continuing the war, while others were willing to sacrifice Japanese lives to push for Japan’s victory. Eventually, as intended by the US, emperor Hirohito announced Japan’s surrender at an Imperial Conference on August 15, 1945. Japan’s surrender officially ended WWII. </p>

			            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Why did the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941? </h2>
			            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941, by the Japanese military was a strategic move aimed at neutralizing the United States’ Pacific Fleet and establishing dominance in the Asia-Pacific region. The primary motivations behind the attack were Japan’s imperialist expansionist ambitions and its desire to secure vital natural resources in Southeast Asia, particularly oil and rubber, which were essential for its war machine. With that established, one question that must be asked is: to what extent did the decision to attack the United States naval fleet at Pearl Harbor make sense from a Japanese perspective at the time?</p>
			            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Prior to the attack, the US had been imposing economic sanctions on Japan in response to its aggression in China and Southeast Asia. This heightened tensions between the two nations. The Japanese leadership believed that a decisive strike at Pearl Harbor would not only cripple the American naval capabilities but also demoralize the US and buy Japan time to consolidate its territorial gains in the Pacific.</p>
			            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;From a Japanese perspective at that time, the decision seemed logical and strategically sound. Japan saw itself as the rising power in the Asia-Pacific region and viewed the US as a declining colonial power. By launching a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan aimed to deliver a devastating blow to American morale and deter any potential US intervention in the Pacific Theater. Moreover, the Japanese military leadership underestimated the US' ability to recover from such a blow quickly. They believed that the attack would give Japan a significant strategic advantage in the region.</p>
			            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;However, while the attack on Pearl Harbor achieved its initial objectives of crippling the US Pacific Fleet and temporarily halting American military capabilities in the region, it ultimately proved to be a grave miscalculation from a long-term strategic standpoint. The attack roused American resolve and united the nation behind the war effort, leading to the US’ entry into WWII. In the end, the decision to attack Pearl Harbor had far-reaching consequences for Japan. It began a series of events that resulted in Japan’s defeat in the war.</p>
