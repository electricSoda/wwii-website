              <h3>Mussolini’s background</h3>
              <p>Benito Mussolini was born into a poor family, with his dad being a blacksmith, and his mom a school teacher. His dad spoke a lot about politics and was a socialist. Mussolini was an aggressive and disobedient child, often being the bully at school. He even stabbed a fellow student. However, he was also very intelligent. As an adult, he read many philosophers and theorists, without much of a political philosophy yet. He became a political journalist and a public speaker soon after, sometimes being arrested for his controversial opinions. Mussolini, after WWI, went from a socialist to an anti-socialist. Emerging in 1918, he advocated for a dictator who was “a man who is ruthless and energetic enough to make a clean sweep” in Italy. He created a new party in Italy called the “fighting bands”. This was the beginning of fascism. His movement gained more traction and he came to power in 1922 where he became the youngest prime minister in Italy.

              <h3>Mussolini's influence on Hitler</h3>
              <p>In the early years of Mussolini’s regime in Italy, Hitler was a great admirer of him. He was fascinated by Mussolini's “march on Rome”, a protest by fascists which led to Mussolini becoming prime minister. Hitler tried to replicate this too: the Munich putsch. Furthermore, Mussolini even supported the Nazi Party through funding and military training with his Blackshirts (his paramilitary). On the outside, Mussolini gave high praise to Hitler’s rise to power, but on the inside he hated Hitler and his party, describing his Mein Kampf as boring, and his ideas and theories as “coarse” and simplistic”. 
               <br> Mussolini and Hitler <b>both</b> considered white Europeans to be architects of civilization and culture
               <br> However, Mussolini <b>did not</b> discriminate against Jewish like Hitler did and scornfully insulted Hitler’s regime.

            <h2 style="text-align:center;">To what extent should Mussolini be considered a significant player in the history of WWII?</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Benito Mussolini, the Italian dictator that gave rise to fascism in the 1920s, was one of the most influential figures during WWII. His authoritarian vision, his leadership skills, his unwavering resilience gave him an edge against his adversaries. Mussolini’s rise to power was not unexpected ever since the creation of the fascist party in Italy. However, the question remains: to what extent did Mussolini impact the course of WWII?     </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;After the quick siege for control from the fascist party, Mussolini became the prime minister of Italy. In a short period of time, Mussolini transformed Italy into a fascist state. Propaganda was instrumental in shaping public perception and consolidating support for Mussolini's regime. A national youth group was created: The Opera Nazionale Balilla, and all other youth groups were banned. This essentially meant that the entire Italian youth would go through propaganda and a nationalistic upbringing, ensuring Mussolini’s continued power. Furthermore, the previous socialistic-dominated parliament was banished and replaced by an entirely fascist body of legislators. Cinemas also were forced to spread propaganda. Journalism was restricted, and although journalists were permitted to criticize the government, they had to generally support the regime. An age of fascism was born.</p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Now, how does this impact WWII?  A leader took notice of Mussolini’s ideologies, admiring his success. This leader would later become the infamous dictator, Adolf Hitler. Hitler, seeing Mussolini’s success in converting Italy into a fascist state, took heavy inspiration from fascism. Mussolini even supported Hitler in his rise to power, allowing his army to train with Hitler’s. After the Nazi party gained tremendous power and began invading other countries, Italy joined forces in the Axis powers. They had created a strong alliance, both promoting the fascist ideology. However, this would be cut short with Italy’s defeat in African colonies, the Allied invasion of Italy, and the ultimate downfall of Nazi Germany in 1945.</p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Even with these short-lived fascist regimes, the legacy remains. Without Mussolini’s success and powerful fascist ideology, Hitler’s regime would have not been what it was. The authoritarian and nationalistic government was the foundation for Nazi Germany. Mussolini’s success with it was without a doubt the driving factor in Hitler and the Nazi party’s rise to power. With the rise of fascism during WWII, it is clear that without Mussolini’s influence in this world war, Hitler’s success would have not been as great, significantly altering the entire history of WWII. </p>

              <h3>Rise of Anti-semitism in Europe: 1 CE - 1950 CE</h3>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">Antisemitism in Europe has been a long debated topic. It dates back before the Common Era, back to when Abraham, the father of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, created the nation of Israel. Before the common era (BCE), Hebrews (early Jewish people) faced persecution because they wouldn’t adopt the religion of other kingdoms. This resulted in the resentment of the Hebrews. After what scholars believe to be the birthdate of Jesus Christ (1 CE), Christianity became a dominant religion, mainly due to the Roman Empire, and since Jewish people refused to accept Jesus, more animosity spawned between Judaism and Christianity. During the Middle Ages, further discrimination against Jews ensued, including that Jews couldn’t marry Christians, couldn’t hold government positions, and that Jews engaged in routine murders of Christians. More and more prejudice against Jews continued, including them becoming the scapegoat for the Bubonic plague during the 14th Century. Throughout the 15-16th century, Christians repeatedly called for the killing of Jews, and in the 13th century, they had to wear a symbol to denote that they were Jewish (something Nazis used as well). These beliefs carried into the modern era, with French,Russian, German, Ukrainian, and English Jews all being persecuted.          </p>

					<h3><u>Nazism</u></h3>
					<p>Also called National Socialism, Nazism is the ideology of racial purity, territorial expansion, nationalism, and militarism. Seen in Nazi Germany, this ideology adds to fascism with a prejudice against Jews.</p>
					<h3><u>Rise of Concentration Camps</u></h3>
					<p>The first concentration camp was created in March 1933 in Dachau. This would become one of the most infamous camps and longest running one. These camps were places where the Nazis kept “enemies of the state” and killed them. These prisoners included most of the people that Nazis had prejudice against
						<ul>
							<li>Gypsies</li>
							<li>Jehovah’s Witnesses</li>
							<li>Gay men</li>
							<li>Men accused of homosexuality</li>
							<li>German Communists</li>
							<li>Socialists</li>
							<li>Social Democrats</li>
							<li>Asocial people</li>
						</ul>
						Basically anyone Nazis determined as “weird” and inferior to their race. These people were confined in harsh conditions.
